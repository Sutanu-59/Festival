<h3>--::GANESH CHATURTHI:::--</h3>
Ganesh Chaturthi (ISO: Gaṇeśa Caturthī), also known as Vinayak Chaturthi (Vināyaka Caturthī), or Ganeshotsav (Gaṇeśōtsava) is a Hindu festival commemorating the birth of the Hindu god Ganesha.[3] The festival is marked with the installation of Ganesha's clay idols privately in homes and publicly on elaborate pandals (temporary stages). Observances include chanting of Vedic hymns and Hindu texts, such as prayers and vrata (fasting).[3] Offerings and prasada from the daily prayers, that are distributed from the pandal to the community, include sweets such as modaka as it is believed to be a favourite of Ganesha.
