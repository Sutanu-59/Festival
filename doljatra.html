<h3>--:::DOLJATRA:::--</h3>
Doljatra is based on the legend of Krishna and Radha in which Lord Krishna expressed his love to his beloved Radha on the day of Doljatra.Like Holi, coloured powder is a key part of festivities, and is known as 'phag' in Bengal. The application of phag starts with a degree of reverence as the powder is applied to pictures of deceased family members, then on the feet of elders as a mark of respect. From then on, it is open season, with everyone up for being given a 'mark of respect' - basically to get covered in phag.
